      <p>Words are so terribly hard to use! Until you can download my unfiltered thoughts into a tube, let me use these crude letters to introduce myself.</p>

      <p>I am a data scientist at UT Health in the Office of Strategic Planning. Passionate about analyzing patient trends to forecast San Antonio's healthcare needs using prescriptive and predictive analytics.</p>

      <p>Turkish tea enthusiast, dedicated Duolingo learner, and Spotify stalker.</p>

      <p>As you're reading this, you're creating data for us to analyze, why don't you take a peek?</p>
