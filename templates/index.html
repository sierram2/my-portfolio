    <div class="hero-description">
        <p>
            Currently, I serve as a Data Scientist at UT Health San Antonio within the Office of Strategic Planning. My role involves navigating the intersection of prescriptive and predictive analytics, where I develop models to forecast healthcare demands and optimize patient centered trends across our community. I enjoy the challenge of finding the signal within the noise to ensure our organization remains prepared for the evolving needs of the city.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I am not at my desk, I find that I do my best thinking while I am out for a run. Jogging has become an essential part of my routine because it mirrors the nature of data science so closely. Both require a great deal of endurance, a steady pace, and the patience to move through the difficult miles before the clear path forward finally reveals itself. Whether I am hitting the pavement or refining a complex algorithm, I value the discipline of showing up every day to make incremental improvements.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of professional and athletic pursuits, I am likely taking a moment to enjoy a glass of Turkish tea, struggling to keep my Duolingo streak alive, or spending far too much time analyzing the trends in my latest Spotify Wrapped.
